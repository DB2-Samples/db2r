# Sample Data
The data required for the R Taxi demo is found in a box folder due to file size limitations on GitHub. Note that this file is a backup image from a Db2 database and is approximately 5.3 GB in size. Make sure that your system has at least twice as much storage available since this file will need to be imported into the Db2 database before you run the demo. Once the data has been imported you can delete the backup image.

The file can be found on box: https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/188069316873. You should not require any logon credentials to download this file.
